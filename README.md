# Arduino Car
I built a basic 4WD car powered by an arduino and cntrolled by a L293D motor driver. THe wheels are controlled by 4 DC motors and they're powered by 4 Li-ON batteries. I was gonna add bluetooth functionality, but my module was defective, so I'll update it once I get my hands on a new module.
